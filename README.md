# rle

A simple run-length encoder/decoder  
Created in 2024 by anson.

This program uses a lossless [run-length encoding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)
to compress ASCII files. There hasn't been any
extensive testing with binary or other data files.
For best results, use ASCII files with long runs of
characters, but `rle` will not inflate any file to more
than its original size.

Usage and options can be read by invoking `rle --help` at the
command line. This project is licensed under the MIT License, See
